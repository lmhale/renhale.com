        <p>There's something powerful about documenting your learning process. It helps you understand better, and it might help someone else too. Imperfection is part of the journey.</p>
        
        <p>I used to think I needed to have everything figured out before I could share anything. I wanted to present polished thoughts, complete solutions, finished products. But that mindset kept me from sharing anything at all.</p>
        
        <p>Learning in public is different. It's about sharing the process, not just the outcome. It's about being vulnerable enough to say "I don't know" and curious enough to figure it out together.</p>
        
        <p>When you document your learning, you create a record of your growth. You can look back and see how your thinking has evolved, what questions you used to ask, what assumptions you used to make.</p>
        
        <p>But more than that, you create value for others who are on similar journeys. Someone else might be struggling with the same problem you just solved. Someone else might have insights that could help you see things differently.</p>
        
        <p>Learning in public isn't about being an expert—it's about being a fellow traveler. It's about recognizing that we're all figuring things out as we go, and that's okay.</p>
        
        <p>So share your half-formed thoughts. Ask the questions that seem obvious. Document your mistakes. The web is better when we learn together.</p>
