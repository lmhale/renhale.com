The indie web isn't about rejecting modern tools—it's about choosing tools that serve you, not the other way around. Own your data, own your voice, own your space.

For too long, we've been content to let others control our digital presence. We post on platforms that can disappear our content, use tools that mine our data, and build on foundations that can crumble at any moment.

The indie web movement is about taking back control. It's about recognizing that your thoughts, your creations, your digital self deserve a permanent home. Not a rented space that can be taken away, but a space you truly own.

This doesn't mean rejecting modern technology. It means being intentional about the technology you choose. It means understanding what you're giving up when you use a service, and deciding if that trade-off is worth it.

When you publish on your own domain, you're not just creating content—you're building a legacy. Every post, every note, every thought becomes part of a permanent record of who you are and what you believe.

The indie web is about agency. It's about choosing to be a creator rather than just a consumer. It's about building something that lasts, something that truly belongs to you.

Start small. Get a domain. Write a single page. Share one thought. You don't need to rebuild the internet—you just need to claim your small corner of it.
