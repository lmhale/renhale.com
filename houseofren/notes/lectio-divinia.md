Beyond biblical Lectio Divinia

[[The Power of Ritual]] creates a 4 step secular framework to practice Lectio Divinia.
1. Literal Reading of the text - what’s happening in the story?
2. Allegory and associations made with other bodies of work, society, or culture
3. How it relates to one’s own life
4. Action you are called to take.
