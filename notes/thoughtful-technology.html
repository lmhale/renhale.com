        <p>Technology should enhance human connection, not replace it. Every tool we build should make us more human, not less.</p>
        
        <p>I've been thinking about the purpose of technology lately. Not just what it can do, but what it should do. What kind of world do we want to create with the tools we build?</p>
        
        <p>Too often, technology seems to push us apart. Social media that creates echo chambers. Algorithms that optimize for engagement rather than understanding. Tools that make us more efficient but less thoughtful.</p>
        
        <p>But technology doesn't have to be this way. It can be a force for connection. For understanding. For making us more human, not less.</p>
        
        <p>Consider the indie web. It's not about rejecting technology—it's about using technology thoughtfully. It's about building tools that serve people, not platforms. It's about creating spaces where genuine connection can happen.</p>
        
        <p>When we build thoughtfully, we ask different questions. Not just "Can we build this?" but "Should we build this?" Not just "Will this scale?" but "Will this help people?"</p>
        
        <p>Thoughtful technology considers the human cost. It asks who benefits and who pays. It recognizes that every design decision has consequences for real people in real communities.</pmetrics>
        
        <p>As developers, we have a responsibility to build technology that serves humanity. That connects rather than divides. That empowers rather than exploits.</p>
        
        <p>The future of technology depends on the choices we make today. Let's choose thoughtfully.</p>
